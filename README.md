# FritzBoxConnectionLogger

The FritzBoxConnectionLogger is simple script to log DSL-Link information from a AVM FritzBox.
The logging script requires https://github.com/kbr/fritzconnection in Version 1.3.5 or greater.

Currently there is a PR pending on the original fritzconnection repo which is needed. 
Until the PR is merged, you can use the following command to install the correct fritzconnection:

``` python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/dkuschmierz/fritzconnection.git@5a2e58f5a23a3ff42a41086190e79e62730f1638 ```
